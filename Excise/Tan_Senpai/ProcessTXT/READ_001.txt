Abstract
This study aimed at testing the efficiency of capital markets, through
testing the effect of internet financial reporting (IFR) and its components
content and format on the expected stock return. The sample consisted of
the public shareholding companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE)
in 2017. IFR index consisted of 30 attributes (12 for content and 18 for
stock return, risk, and trading volume. An OLS analysis was used to test
make their investment decisions. The results provide a basis for mapping
existing and future studies on Internet reporting and constructing
scenarios of future Internet financial reporting. Our study contributes to
the emerging literature by expanding our understanding of how the
investors can depend heavily on IFR to make their investment decisions.
The results should be of interest to the public shareholding companies,
regulators in Jordan, and other jurisdictions planning internet financial
reporting initiatives.

1. Introduction
Around the world an ever-increasing number of companies have
World Wide Web (Web) sites on the Internet (Lymer et al., 1999). In the
UK literature, some studies use first-generation of digital reporting to
refer to the first level of Internet reporting whereby companies make their
business information available online (Cobb, 2008; Dunne et al., 2009).
Companies are able to convert their business information from paper
based reporting into Portable Document Format or Hyper Text Mark-Up
Language, and they disseminate the information on their websites
(Debreceny and Gray, 1999; Allam and Lymer, 2003). The main advantage
of this process is to allow greater amounts of information about the
company to be accessed by a diverse range of stakeholders on the Internet
(Adams and Frost, 2004). Thus, it allows businesses to create a presence
on the Web (Gray and Debreceny, 1997; Lymer et al., 1999, Azam and
Taylor, 2012).
First-generation digital reporting is designed to address the issues of
using paper or electronic medium like CD-ROM. CD-ROM was an early
attempt to break away from paper-based reporting (Lymer et al., 1999).
Although using CD-ROMs is cheaper and quicker than paper-based
reporting to distribute large amounts of business and financial information
to different stakeholders, they are still distributed by physical means
(Lymer et al., 1999; Azam and Taylor, 2012). In addition, the sender of
business information should keep some personal information about the
receivers (such as name and addresses, etc.) to make sure that information
is sent to the intended destination. Moreover, sharing of CD-ROMs is slow,
expensive and clumsy between different users in the office environment,
compared with other new technologies, for example, PDFs. Recently, most
companies use the power of the internet to provide useful information to 
Internet Financial Reporting and Expected Stock Return
3
the users of financial statements (Kieso et al., 2011).
In the literature, similar terms with a common meaning are used,
including online business reporting (Boritz and No, 2003), web-based
business reporting (Lymer et al., 1999), Internet corporate reporting
(Lymer and Tallberg, 1997; Lymer and Debrecency, 2003), Internet
financial reporting (Debreceny and Gray, 1999, 2001; Xiao et al., 2002;
Jones and Xiao, 2003). They broadly discuss the benefits, challenges and
issues that are expected from using Internet technologies to submit the
business information on the Internet. Diamond and Verrecchia (1991)
found that if the level of disclosures is increased, the level of information
asymmetry is decreased, resulting in more demand from investors. Yoon et
al (2011) show that business reporting in the XBRL format is important to
filing companies. Thus, if a company publish highly quality financial
reports in standard format, investors are more likely to appraise the
company as less risky. This could lead to a decrease in the cost of capital
and an increase in the firm's stock price. If the level of financial
disclosures is increased by adopting IFR, information asymmetry is
expected to be reduced, which could lead to a decrease in the cost of
capital and an increase in the firm value.
Following previous studies on Internet financial reporting
(Debreceny and Gray, 1999, 2001; Xiao et al., 2002; Jones and Xiao,
2003), we define Internet Financial reporting (IFR) as the public reporting
of financial data by public shareholding companies via the World Wide
Web or related Internet-based communications medium. In this study, IFR
can be accessed either by Google search engine to determine the
availability of a Website or/and the Web site of Securities Depository
Center (SDC) in Jordan. Companies might be motivated to use internet to
disseminate information to users to gain benefits such as cutting costs of
distributing hard copies of financial reports, and facilitating 
Mohammed M. Yassin, -Khatib
4
communication with different stakeholders (Xiao et al., 2002). Companies'
websites, in particular, are a vital means of communication for investor
relations departments, making them a major source of information for
investors and analysts (ICAEW, 2004).
Despite IFR is still a voluntary disclosure tool in developing
countries (Ojah and Mokoaleli, 2012), the IASB issued guidelines for IFR,
indicating that any report provided online should have a uniform scope as
the traditional hard copy versions. The IASB aimed with these guidelines
to provide users with complete, transparent and safe financial information
on the internet (Lymer et al., 1999). In addition to that, Chapter 5 -
Paragraph 4 of the corporate governance code for Amman Stock Exchange
Commission, 2015).
IFR should help in bridging the gap between investors and managers
in addition to reducing information asymmetry between informed and
uninformed investors (Jean-François, 2015), but away from that, the
voluntary nature of information provided by IFR has led to different
content and format (FASB, 2000) which makes it difficult to achieve
consistency, completeness, and reliability of financial information.
Recent studies have argued that stock market return is predictable
over short horizons (Bollerslev et al., 2014). Expected stock return is a
function of information (Lipe, 1990). If a company provides high quality
standard financial information in its content and format, investors will
appraise the company as less risky. This will be reflected into a decrease in
the cost of capital, which will increase the stock return (Yoon et al., 2011).
In addition, Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) argued that the increase in
disclosure level will be reflected in a decrease in information asymmetry, 
Internet Financial Reporting and Expected Stock Return
5
which will result an increase in stock return.
Prior studies in the accounting literature provide evidence on some
that expected returns tend to line up with various firm characteristics.
Harvey et al. (2016) lists 314 factors that predict stock returns, and found
some of them are highly correlated. Subrahmanyam (2010) based on more
than 50 variables to predict stock returns, but the findings suggest that
more needs to be done to assert the predictability of these variables.
(Green et al., 2013) analyzed the population of return predictive signals
(RPS) and found more than 330 signals have been reported. Ou and
Penman (1989) conducted a financial statement analysis and aggregated
financial characteristics from financial statements into one composite
measure which can predict future earnings and returns. They suggested
that financial statements capture fundamentals that are not reflected in
prices.
Lai et al., 2010 suggested that there are large number of variables
which related to expected returns poses some important questions: Which
information is most important to expect the stock returns? And how to
aggregate this information to construct the most precise estimates of
expected returns?. Prior research in this context focused on firm
characteristics collected from the reported financial statements (e.g. Light
et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2016; Green et al., 2013; Subrahmanyam, 2010;
Ou and Penman, 1989) with a noticeable ignorance of the other
information. Although the abundant research on IFR focused on the
determinants of IFR (e.g. Yassin, 2017; Almilia, 2015; Cormier et al., 2008;
Debreceny et al., 2002; Ashbaugh et al., 1999), there is limited research
concentrated on IFR consequences as suggested by Lai et al., (2010) and
Wagenhofer (2007). This paper attempts to understand the effect of IFR on
the market efficiency of Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). The main 
Mohammed M. Yassin, -Khatib

purpose is to test whether IFR can predict the stock return. Our study
addresses the following research question: Does IFR affect the expected
stock return?
The paper is organized as follows. First, it reviews the literature
relevant to IFR and its relationship to stock return. Second, the research
methodology is presented. Third, the results are discussed. Finally, the
paper concludes.
2. Literature Review And Hypotheses Development
The Jordanian government has implemented some initiatives to
encourage the use of IFR by large listed companies In 2006, the ASE
signed a cross-listing agreement with ADX and DFM (Addustour
Newspaper, 2007) in Jordan which provides companies an opportunity to
access the high-liquidity markets that began to emerge over the last few
years (Yassin, 2017).
Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) predicted that if markets are
efficient then, in equilibrium, stock prices only respond when useful
information entering the market (Beaver, 1968). Fama (1969) argued that
 information in
stock prices. That is, when information arises, the news will incorporate
into the stock price quickly. Thus, neither technical nor fundamental
analysis would enable an investor to achieve abnormal returns. EMH is
represent random departures from previous prices. That is, if information
 price changes
today. As a result, prices fully reflect all known information, and
uninformed investors will obtain the same rate of return as that achieved 
Internet Financial Reporting and Expected Stock Return
7
by the informed investors. Departing from the random walk idea, many
financial economists and statisticians started to believe that stock prices
are at least partially predictable (Malkiel, 2003).
Recent research suggested that shareholders with better access to
quality accounting information should be able to protect themselves more
effectively against self-serving managers and to make better decisions
concerning the purchase of new equity (Berglöf and Pajuste, 2005).
Organizations consider IFR a tool to communicate effectively with
investors, stockholders, and other stakeholders, and organizations can
increase the quantity of information and can disclose disaggregate and
incremental financial information on their web sites (Ashbaugh et al.,
1999). Lymer et al. (1999) concluded that decision making processes were
accelerated by improving financial disclosure and by providing more
timely information. Furthermore, IFR can increase the share liquidity and
lowers the cost of capital by enhancing disclosures (Oyeler et al., 2003).
Recently, a number of studies have been emerged in the area of IFR
(e.g. Larren, 2002; Pervan, 2006; Cormier et al., 2009). The literature
provides evidence that organizations benefit from IFR in increasing firm
value, and decreasing cost of financing. Their results support their
arguments, which showed that the more IFR, greater transparency, broader
ranges of information, consequently the more firm value and the less
investor risk.
Profitability motivates management to use IFR. Aly et al. (2010),
Al-Sakarneh (2011), and Miniaoui and Oyelere (2013) found that
profitability positively affects IFR. Ahmed et al. (2002) concluded that
more profitable firms tend to disclose more information because
management likes to show off its achievements to reflect a good reputation
and to raise capital under the best terms. Balvers et al. (2017) found that 
Mohammed M. Yassin, -Khatib
8
stock return is determined by profitability, they argued that profitable
firms are predicted to have higher returns.
Furthermore, voluntary financial reporting had been examined in a
considerable amount of literature in the last decade (e.g. Liu et al., 2018;
Guay et al., 2016; Dhaliwal et al., 2014; Dhaliwal et al., 2011; Beyer et al.,
2010). There is some evidence about the benefits that companies gain
from voluntary disclosure, such as enhancing firm value, reducing
information asymmetry, and reducing the cost of financing. In this line,
IFR should reflect the disclosed information in the stock price, which in
turn will provide greater value investors, taking into consideration that
IFR will make the information available to all investors without delay and
with minimum information asymmetry (Lai et al., 2010). Accordingly, our
first hypothesis is as follows:
H0: IFR is significantly positively affects expected stock return.
3. Amman Stock Exchange In The Arab Region
The main objective of the cross-listing agreement signed between
ASE from one side and ADX and DFM from the other side in 2006, is to
attract the cross-borders investors. ASE plays an important role in
diversifying the types of instruments available to investors, in addition to
removing the restrictions on foreign investments in listed companies
(Saadi-Sedik and Petri, 2006).
ASE is an active member in the Arab Federation of Exchanges (AFE)
since 1999. Also it is a member in the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock
Exchanges (FEAS) and World Federation of Exchanges (WFE)
(http://www.ase.com.jo). 
Internet Financial Reporting and Expected Stock Return

ASE is composed of three major sectors; financial, industrial, and
service. The market is organized as first and second markets which
classify the securities into them based on listing rules. Equity instruments
are the most traded in the market, and most trading occurs in the first
market (Saadi-Sedik and Petri, 2006).
Table (1) shows the AFE statistics for the year 2017 which indicates
that ASE occupied the ninth rank among sixteen Arab exchanges in terms
of market capitalization, the eighth rank in terms of traded shares value,
the sixth in terms of number of trades, and the second in the number of
listed companies which reached to 195 companies. This number was a
result of good market environment, which could offer an attraction to
potential cross-borders investment opportunities.
A study performed by the AFE aimed at testing the readiness of its
members to attract international investors, and it had listed some
characteristics for the member exchanges, and it concluded that many of
the Arab exchanges have many advantages for investors to encourage their
external investments. Unfortunately, during the downtrend periods, the
Arab Exchanges suffer from lack of liquidity. Some efforts are conducted
now in order to enhance this liquidity (Khalaf, 2018) However,, they
meet the international requirements and needs, such as the full disclosure,
tudies, the Market Making
(Khalaf, 2015).

4. Research Methodology
4.1 Sampling
This study consisted of Jordanian public shareholding companies
listed on the ASE at the end of 2017, which represents the latest data
available about the listed companies. A comprehensive population was
surveyed to include all 195 of the companies listed. Table (2) provides a
description of the population according to the sectors they belong to.
Twenty two companies were eliminated because they were excluded from
listing on the ASE for the reasons of mergers, reductions of shareholding
capital, or missing data. The final sample was 173 companies.

4.2 Data Collection
Data about the independent variable (IFR) were collected from two
sources: Google search engine to determine the availability of a Website or
not, and the Web site of Securities Depository Center (SDC). Then, the
companies with Web sites were investigated for IFR engagement. It could 
Mohammed M. Yassin, -Khatib
12
be noticed from table (2) that 79 percent of the listed companies maintain
websites, representing 94 percent of the service sector, 79 percent of the
industrial sector, and 74 percent of the financial sector.
Data about the dependent variable were collected from two sources:
the latest company guide available on the ASE website and financial
reports.
4.3 Measurements
4.3.1 Model
Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression was used to predict the
expected stock return using IFR and its components content and format,
in addition to control variables as shown in equation (1), noting that IFR,
content and format will be tested separately in three different models (1, 2,
and 3 as shown in the results), each with the control variables.
(1)
Where: is the expected stock return for company i in the period t,
 is Internet Financial Reporting Index, is the content of
IFR, is the format of IFR, is the leverage, is
the firm size, is the profitability, is the liquidity, and
is the error term. 
Internet Financial Reporting and Expected Stock Return
13
4.3.2 Dependent Variable
Expected stock return will be calculated in two steps:
First, stock return is calculated using the difference between current
price and previous price plus dividends, all divided by previous stock
price.
Second, following (Karpoff, 1987; Brock and Lebaron, 1996; Lee
and Rui, 2002; Mestel et al., 2003; Yassin et al., 2015) stock return is
return, risk, and trading volume. Where, the stock risk will be measured
following (Floros, 2009) as the difference between highest price and
lowest price, all divided by the daily average stock price. The trading
volume will be measured by calculating the natural logarithm of the daily
trading volume.
This study used the following model shown in equation (2) to
estimate stock return:
 (2)
Where is the expected stock return for company i in the period t,
 is the stock return for company i in the previous period t-1,
is the stock risk for company i in the period t, is the trading volume
for company i in the period t, and is the error term.
The companies tested in equation number (1) should have at least 180
trading days per year in order to avoid the thin trading problem. The final
sample was 85 companies. 
Mohammed M. Yassin, -Khatib

4.3.3 Independent Variable
Previous researchers have shown that IFR could be divided into
content and format (Yap et al., 2011). following (Sharma, 2013; Yap et al.,
2011; Damaso & Lourenco, 2011; Homayoun & Abdul Rahman, 2010;
Ettredge et al., 2001), an IFR index was developed and contained of 30
attributes (12 for the content, and 18 for the format) as shown in table (3).
Following Kelton and Yang (2008) and Homayoun and Abdul Rahman
(2010), this study employed an un-weighted approach because it avoids
weighting subjectivity.

5.1 Univariate Analysis
The study performs univariate descriptive analysis of the collected
data. The final sample of 173 companies was divided into two categories:
IFR companies and non-IFR companies. Univariate analysis for these
companies is presented in Table (5). The results indicate the presence of
means that IFR companies are larger than non-IFR companies.

5.2 Multivariate Analysis
As mentioned earlier, 137 companies were described as IFR
companies, 85 of them have data about stock return. OLS regression
analysis was employed to test our hypothesis.
Using equation (2), expected stock return was estimated, and the
results of this estimation is shown in table (6).

Using the estimated betas from table (6), we calculate the estimated
expected return for each company. Then we use these values in equation (1)
to test our hypothesis. Employing OLS regression analysis, we found the
following results shown in table (7).
Table (7) summarizes the regression results of the effects of IFR
practices, its content and format on expected stock returns. It is clear from
model (1) that the composite index of IF
0.05). These findings remained constant in models (2) and (3) for the
effect of content and format, but the significance of profitability faded in
model (2).
The findings in model (1) and (3) are normal, but the unusual finding
is the insignificance effect of profitability on the expected stock return in
model (2), and this could be referred to combining it with the content of
IFR which could be seen as the major determinant of the expected stock
return.

By examining the R-squared across the three models in Table (7),
which regressed the expected stock return for IFR and its components in
addition to control variables, one can note that the explanatory power of
the composite-IFR, IFR-content, and IFR-format were high, ranging from
57.2% to 62.1%, indicating that IFR and its components are major
determinants of expected stock return.
To summarize, OLS results generally support H0, and this support
was persistent in all of the three models - IFR, content, and format.
6. Conclusion
The number of investors who use the internet to search for
investment opportunities and to conduct online stock trading is constantly
growing, making IFR an important area of academic research (Kelton and
Yang, 2008). Although it is still voluntarily used in Jordanlike other 
Mohammed M. Yassin, -Khatib
20
countries worldwide. The internet is used intensively by companies to
disseminate financial information (Debreceny et al., 2002). This study
builds on prior stock returns and IFR research by studying the effect of
IFR and its components content and format on the expected stock return.
decisions.
The results of the univariate analysis indicate that IFR companies are
more profitable than non-IFR ones. Multivariate OLS analysis was applied
and showed that expected stock return could be estimated using IFR and
its components content and format. The results should help in enhancing
IFR on the web sites of companies in a way that help investors make the
right decision. In addition, policy makers and regulators will improve
their information concerning the voluntary IFR practices in a way that
may help in formulating policies that enhance the market efficiency. this
paper will help in setting the basic standards of eXtensible Business
Reporting Language (XBRL) in Jordan, since ASE as many other
exchanges in the Middle East is setting to leverage the standard to help
raise the visibility of public companies to walk in the footsteps of Abu
Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) and Dubai Financial Market (DFM) in
United Arab Emirates and TADAWUL in Saudi Arabia (XBRL, 2016).
The results also provide empirical evidence for regulators to consider
a generally accepted framework for IFR instead of keeping it voluntary
because of the increasing use of the internet as a tool to disseminate
financial information, XBRL is spreading quickly around the world, and
stakeholders benefit from internet reporting for making decisions. Further
research could employ different indexes of IFR. Also, using different
models for expected stock return to test the robustness of results. One
limitation of this research is the use of one year data, depending on the
available information.
